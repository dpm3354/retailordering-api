This repository is an example of how to use mocks to create rest-assured 
api tests. Code created for use in webinar on September 21, 2017 at 1pm ET
at beaufortfairmont.com/webinars entitled "What's a Mock and How Do I Use 
It?" from Beaufort Fairmont and D. Paul Merrill. Make sure to check out the 
recording available at the same link after that date.
